# README #
This repository is part of the piccolo2 project based on [piccolo](https://bitbucket.org/itrobinson/piccolo) software. This package contains common infrastructure used by the other piccolo2 components.

The Piccolo is a small light-weight dual-field-of-view spectroradiometer for use on unmanned aerial vehicles and monitoring sites. It was designed and built by [Dr Alasdair Mac Arthur](https://bitbucket.org/alasdairmacarthur/)  and [Dr Iain Robinson](https://bitbucket.org/itrobinson/) of the Natural Environment Research Council's National Centre for Earth Observation Field Spectroscopy Facility, GeoSciences, University of Edinburgh. The new software is developed by [Dr Magnus Hagdorn](https://bitbucket.org/magnus_hagdorn/).
